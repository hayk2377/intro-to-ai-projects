## Introduction

During my Introduction to AI coursework, I worked on a group project to train simple models for various classification tasks:

* **Article Classification:** Predicting categories of news articles.
* **Digit Recognition:** Identifying numbers from low-resolution images.
* **Weather Prediction:** Estimating weather conditions based on location, season, and climate.

## Group Project (December 02, 2023)

My copy of the project can be found in the `GROUP2` folder.

## Personal Projects

In addition to the group project, I also explored some personal interests in AI:

* **Tic Tac Toe with Minimax:** Developed a playing algorithm using the minimax search technique (Python).
* **Faster Tic Tac Toe with Alpha-Beta Pruning:** Enhanced the Tic Tac Toe algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for faster decision-making (Python).
* **N-Queens Problem with Hill Climbing and Genetic Algorithms:** Implemented solutions for the N-Queens problem using hill climbing and genetic algorithms (Python).

These projects are located in the `personal-projects` folder.

**Technology Stack:**

* Python
